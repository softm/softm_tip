        ● About The Code
            The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document.
            If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it
            on the Development mailing list. All input is gladly appreciated!

            All of the code is available in two formats:

                * Compressed (which allows you to have a significantly smaller file size) and
                * Uncompressed (good for debugging and to understand what is behind the magic).

            If you're interested in downloading Plugins developed by jQuery contributors, please visit the Plugins page.

            jQuery is provided under the following MIT and GPL licenses.

        ● CDN Hosted jQuery
            A number of large enterprises provide hosted copies of jQuery on existing CDN networks that are available
            for public use. Below are links to the CDN-hosted copies of jQuery that you may hotlink to.

            * jQuery CDN (Edgecast via (mt))
                  o http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js Minified version
                  o http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.js Source version
                  o Please do not link to versions of jQuery on static.jquery.com or dev.jquery.com; hotlinking to these subdomains will be disabled in Q3 of 2010 and your sites will break!
            * Google Ajax API CDN
                  o http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js

        4. Choose a version of jQuery UI
        5. Click Download!

    ● Intro to using jQuery UI
        Once you've downloaded jQuery UI, you'll get a zip containing the following files:

            * /css/
            * /development-bundle/
            * /js/
            * index.html

    ● Basic overview: using jQuery UI on a web page

        Open up index.html in a text editor and you'll see that it links to a few dependencies:
        your theme, jQuery, and jQuery UI. Generally, you'll need to include these 3 files on any page
        to use jQuery UI widgets and interactions:

            <link type="text/css" href="css/themename/jquery-ui-1.8.custom.css" rel="Stylesheet" />
            <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-ui-1.8.custom.min.js"></script>

        Once you've included the necessary files, you can add some jQuery widgets to your page.
        For example, to make a datepicker widget, you'll add a text input element to your page and then
        call .datepicker(); on it.
        Like this: HTML: <input type="text" name="date" id="date" />

        $('●date').datepicker();
